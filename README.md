# Spontaneous periodic ordering on the surface and in the bulk of dielectrics irradiated by ultrafast laser

## Layout of the project

## Work to do
1- Write the Read_plot_image file to check if able to reconstruct correctly an image without any information on it
2- Develop a function "Image_roughness" which will be the initial condition for the roughness layer which will be read by the FDTD code.
3- Define the amplitude of the roughness layer as a parameter (number of cells) and convert 256 levels of grey into defined number of cells
4- Calculate the field Eab for several images
5- Discuss the location of absorption for several images
