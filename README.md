# Spontaneous periodic ordering on the surface and in the bulk of dielectrics irradiated by ultrafast laser

## Layout of the project

## Usage

## Work to do
[] Write the Read_plot_image file to check if able to reconstruct correctly an image without any information on it
[] Develop a function "Image_roughness" which will be the initial condition for the roughness layer which will be read by the FDTD code.
[] Define the amplitude of the roughness layer as a parameter (number of cells) and convert 256 levels of grey into defined number of cells
[] Calculate the field Eab for several images
[] Discuss the location of absorption for several images
